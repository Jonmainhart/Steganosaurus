# Steganosaurus
Final project for CMSC 495.

*Steganosaurus* is an image-based steganography application written in Python 3.9 that can both encode secret conversations and reveal the secret data of an uploaded image from the user. Steganography is an information encoding technique that has been used throughout history to send secret messages without attracting attention. 
Why *Steganosaurus*? Steganosaurus is a portmanteau of *steganography* and *stegosaurus* because dinosaurs are cool.
