The assets/ folder will contain icon images and any other graphics used to enhance the look and feel of the application (for example, default images).

The test_images/ folder will contain at least two un-encoded test images and two test images which contain a coded message for testing. Will be removed from distribution after we get a grade.

The steganosaurus/ folder will contain the main application files.
- gui.ky is the GUI layout for kivy and will contain all style elements of the GUI
- __main__.py is the file which will start the application. This file shall remain free of any application code.
- stego.py will contain all GUI handlers and any necessary runtime variables and functions required to launch the application. This is the heart of the application.
- utils.py will contain all functions that will be required by the application. Examples include the opening and saving files, converting strings, and user alert functions.
- models.py will contain the ImageObject class declaration. It may be used to expand functionality to handle other file types in the future.

The requirements.txt file will enumerate all required packages needed to run the application.

Your dev environment will need to be set up to include the required imports. You can use an virtual environment for this if you choose to keep things tidy on your system. Otherwise, you can install them as normal using pip.

Recommended imports (purpose in parenthesis):
import kivy (GUI framework)
from PIL import Image (Extract/modify image pixels)

Recommend everyone install Bandit, PyLint, and SonarLint to check your code before you submit it for review.
